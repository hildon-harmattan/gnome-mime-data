# Build zipfile distribution of gnome-mime-data for Win32. Run after
# make install.

# No, I don't claim that it will necessarily make much sense having a
# gnome-mime-data package for Win32. This is just for completeness as
# many GNOME libraries depend in their configure.in on
# gnome-mime-data, and as for now it's easiest to have it installed
# when building them. But very likely the users of gnome-mime-data
# will eventually have code to use more native Win32 mechanisms for
# the function that gnome-mime-data has on a Unix
# system. --tml@novell.com
